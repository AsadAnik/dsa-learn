# Data Structures & Algorithm

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.

Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.

Knowing DSA can help you perform better in job interviews and land great jobs in tech companies.

üí° In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.

**`Primitive Data Structures:`**¬†are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.

**`Abstract Data Structures:`**¬†are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

### Guides with roadmap
This guidline will help you to learn data structures and algorithms in a systematic and efficient manner.

### 1. **Master the Basics of Data Structures**

- **Arrays** and **Strings**: Learn how to manipulate arrays and strings, as they're fundamental to solving many problems.
- **Linked Lists**: Get comfortable with singly and doubly linked lists, understanding traversal and manipulation.
- **Stacks** and **Queues**: Understand their usage in managing data flow, especially in recursive functions and order-based processing.
- **Hash Maps** (or **Hash Tables**): Essential for optimizing search, storing unique items, and handling duplicates.

**Resources**: Start with online tutorials or basic practice sites (like LeetCode or HackerRank) for problem-specific understanding.

### 2. **Move to Core Algorithms**

- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Know basics like bubble, selection, insertion, merge, and quicksort. Master binary search, as it‚Äôs commonly tested.
- **Two-Pointer and Sliding Window Techniques**: Widely used for array and string problems, these techniques optimize many coding challenges.

**Resources**: Focus on problems tagged with these techniques on coding sites. Practicing will make spotting them in questions easier.

### 3. **Intermediate Data Structures**

- **Trees** and **Graphs**: Cover basics of tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and graph traversal (BFS, DFS).
- **Heaps** (or **Priority Queues**): Useful for finding the maximum or minimum elements quickly.

**Resources**: LeetCode and NeetCode‚Äôs DSA roadmap cover trees and graphs in-depth.

### 4. **Practice with Coding Challenges**

- **Online Platforms**: Practice on platforms like LeetCode, CodeSignal, or Turing‚Äôs own practice platform if they have one. Start with ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù problems and move to ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù as you get comfortable.
- **Mock Interviews**: Use platforms like Pramp or interview prep tools in LeetCode and CodeSignal to simulate the interview experience and manage time effectively.

### 5. **Time Complexity and Problem Solving**

- **Big O Notation**: Understand the time and space complexity for common algorithms and data structures.
- **Pattern-Based Problem Solving**: Identify common patterns in problems (e.g., sliding window, two-pointer) to solve them faster.
